Welcome to the **Notepad++ & Plugin Development** category

This category _is_ for:
- specific source code questions
- build-specific questions (for those that are trying to build from source but are stuck on something)
- plugin development - how to interface with Notepad++ through the [Plugin Communication](https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/plugin-communication/) interface

This category is _not_ for:
- Notepad++ feature requests: see our [FAQ](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/15741/faq-desk-feature-request-or-bug-report)
- Generic programming questions:
    - If you are new to a specific programming language, there are plenty of other places on the web to learn and ask general programming questions.  
    - If you are a long-time Notepad++ plugin contributor, but still find yourself having difficulty with a non-Notepad++\-specific portion of developing your plugin, it's still better for it to go in some forum better equipped to handle Win32 API questions or similar.
    - Discussions here should be focused on the concepts that are specifically related to Notepad++ itself, and interfacing between Notepad++ and your plugin, rather than on specifics about Win32 API or non-Notepad++\-specific libraries.

Grey Area:
- Plugin feature requests or bug reports aren't specifically banned here, as some of the plugin authors do frequent this Category.  _However_, there is no guarantee that an author will notice or track such reports in this Forum, and it is **highly encouraged** that you report them through the plugin project's repository bug/feature tracking system to ensure that the right people see them; regulars here are likely to push you to do that if you don't include a link to your issue when you make your post.
