my proposal for the policy:

# Policy - Personal Attacks and Hate Speech are Forbidden

The purpose of this policy is not to punish Community members for losing their temper, or occasionally being rude.  And if someone wants to rant against Notepad++, there's a whole [forum Category "Boycott Notepad++"](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/8/boycott-notepad) dedicated to whining and complaining.

But there are times when behavior goes beyond just being rude to true personal attacks and even hate speech.  Such behavior is **not** tolerated, and forum moderators or administrators can and will take action to prevent or remove such behavior.

Such behavior includes, but is not limited to,
- Personal or _ad hominem_ attacks against one or more individuals
- Threats of violence or harm against anyone
- Hate speech

Actions that can be taken include:
- Warning a user through Direct Message (the forum's "Chat" interface)
- Warning a user through public posts in the forum
- Moving posts to the [Boycott Notepad++](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/8/boycott-notepad) category
- Hiding or deleting posts
- Temporarily banning a user
- Permanently banning a user
- Other forum-appropritate actions

As an aside, the author of Notepad++ will occasionally put a political statement or off-color joke, hidden or obvious, inside the application or the source code.  The Notepad++ Community members have no control over such decisions.  If you want to complain about his politics or rant against his exercise of free speech, the [Boycott Notepad++](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/8/boycott-notepad) is available for such posts.  But even there, users are expected to not violate this policy.

If Community users notice a post or user which they believe to be in violation of this policy, they are encouraged to "flag" such a post and/or user, and the administrators and moderators should then investigate and take appropriate action.

Moderators and Administrators are given discretion in interpreting when such behavior violates this policy, and in deciding which actions are appropriate for a given violation.  They are not here to be "thought police" or to enforce personal vendettas against particular users, but they are here to ensure that this Community forum is a place for reasonable discussion about Notepad++.
