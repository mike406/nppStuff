this is my proposal for the policy

# Policy - Generative AI and Bots

The expectation of this Notepad++ Community forum is that there will be a real human behind each account used in this Community and behind each post made in this Community.  The use of automated posting programs or algorithms ("bots") is not generally helpful to the Community.  The use of Artificial Intelligence (also known as "AI": including, but not limited to, "Generative AI", "Predictive AI", ChatGPT, other AI interfaces, search-engine-based auto-generated results, or other types of computer programs or algorithms that create textual output based on textual input or prompts or randomly), is not generally helpful to the Community.  Posts created solely or primarily by bots or Generative AI or other means of artificially creating posts will disrupt and interfere with the Community, and lower the quality of the discussion, and are therefore not allowed.

It may be impossible to know for sure whether a particular post or user is making use of such tools for creating posts, but there are often signs and hints in posts that will lead moderators and administrators to conclude that a post violates this policy.  (Such signs and hints will not be enumerated here, because they may change over time, and any such list could be used to try to train the AI to better get away with violating this policy.)

If one or more forum administrators or moderators in the Notepad++ Community believe that a post is in violation of this policy, or that a user has a history of creating posts that are in violation of this policy, the administrators and moderators have the authority to take appropriate action against such posts or users, including but not limited to:
- Warning a user through Direct Message (the forum's "Chat" interface)
- Warning a user through public posts in the forum
- Moving posts to the [Boycott Notepad++](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/8/boycott-notepad) category
- Hiding or deleting posts
- Temporarily banning a user
- Permanently banning a user
- Other forum-appropritate actions

If Community users notice a post or user which they believe to be in violation of this policy, they are encouraged to "flag" such a post and/or user, and the administrators and moderators should then investigate and take appropriate action.
