Hello, and welcome to the FAQ Desk.  If you were directed here, you reported seeing large "gaps" or "blank areas" in the Notepad++ User Interface around the text-editing pane.

It probably looks something like this: ![](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/assets/uploads/files/1632755745329-screenshot-2021-09-27-161440.jpg)

These blank areas are a known issue.  Unfortunately, as of yet, there doesn't seem to be a fix that the developers can implement.

Some users have had luck with switching to Administrator mode, or rebooting, or updating video drivers, so trying that may help you.

You can read some of the previous discussions for ideas; also, you can watch the official issue [#9717](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues/9717) to see whether progress is made on this issue.
