# Proposal

The following is a proposal for a list of Forum Rules.  
I think it should be posted as a pinned topic at the top of the FAQ and/or in each of the forum categories, or somewhere else that makes it obvious to most users.

I don't want it posted by the "PeterJones" user, because I am just a user, and have no special authority or responsibility in the Forum.  
I want input from the moderators (and maybe even Don).  Then, once there is concensus, a moderator (or Don) should be the one to post it, to give these rules the 
weight of authority that they need.

# Notepad++ Community Rules

Hello, and welcome to the Notepad++ Community.  We look forward to discussing Notepad++ with you, 
or helping you with your questions.

But first, here are some rules for the Forum.

This is a Notepad++ discussion forum.  Please keep the focus of your questions or discussion on Notepad++, 
its features and uses, and ways to use Notepad++ with Plugins and/or external tools.

There is a [FAQ Desk](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/7/faq), with answers to common topics on the Forum.

Please be polite and treat other Community Forum members with respect.

Please understand that this is not official paid support: regulars in the Forum spend their time here voluntarily,
and are here to discuss Notepad++ and help others use Notepad++ to the fullest.  But that means that at times, 
your question will not be answered in a matter of minutes, hours, or sometimes even days.  That might be because
the expert on your topic isn't around, or because we don't know the answer, or because your question got buried
and no one has noticed you don't yet have an answer -- sorry, it can easily happen.

Please note that while we will try to help you, and even can try to confirm software bugs with you, this 
Forum is not the official [issue tracker](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues).  
If there is a bug in Notepad++, posting about it in this Community Forum will _not_ make an official request 
to get the bug fixed.  We have a FAQ which describes how to make [bug reports or feature requests](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/15741/faq-desk-feature-request-or-bug-report).

English is the primary language of this Forum.  If you choose to post in another language, it is considered
polite to translate your text into English as well.  There are free online translators avaialble, like translate.google.com and deepl.com.  
Feel free to make use of those to help you communicate in English.

## Category Descriptions ##

The main [Categories](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/categories) are described below.  Please try to keep
Topics in the correct Category.

The lines can be blurry between some of the Categories, especially **Help Wanted**, **General Discussion**, and **Blogs**.  
If in doubt, questions go in **Help Wanted** and most anything else can go in **General Discussion**.


* [Announcements](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/1/announcements): "Announcements regarding our community".
    
    This is where official "new release" and "release candidate" annoucements go.  Please keep replies to those Topics on the
    narrow focus of that specific release or candidate: you can mention new bugs instroduced in that version, or regressions
    of things that used to work in previous versions, but no longer work.  But requests for help, or discussion of other problems 
    or bugs that you have with Notepad++ that existed in previous versions should go in a new Topic in one of the other Categories.

* [FAQ](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/category/7/faq): "Frequently Asked Questions".  
    
    This contains answers to questions that pop up frequently in the Forum -- both about Notepad++ and about the Forum itself.
    If you have a question or discussion regaring one of the FAQ entries, please create a new Topic in **Help Wanted** or 
    **General Discussion**, and post a link to the FAQ you are talking about.

* [General Discussion](...): "A place to talk about whatever you want".

    In general, this should be Notepad++ related discussion that doesn't fit in any of the other categories.

* [Help wanted · · · – – – · · ·](...): "Got a question? Ask away!"

    This is where questions about Notepad++, how to use it, asking if some strange behavior might be a bug, etc, should go.
    When in doubt about where your Notepad++ question belongs, this is the Category to use for your question.

* [Plugin Development](...): "All the issues (questions/bug reports/feature requests) about plugins"

    The primary focus of this Category is on developing plugins.  But often questions on how to install or use a plugin also go here.
    Desired features for specific plugins can be discussed here, but this Forum is not necessarily visited by a specific plugin's
    author; if it's a confirmed bug, you will want to check if that plugin has its own issue tracker and make sure you submit
    your request there.
    
* [Security](...): "Security shouldn't be the privilege of rich people"

    Discussions about the application signing, or security implications of file locations, etc, should go in this Category.

* [Translation](...): "All the issues (publications/questions) about binary translation"

    If you want to ask about the translations of the Notepad++ UI into other languages, this is the place.

* [BOYCOTT NOTEPAD++](...): "Say !@#$ to Notepad++ here, and only here"

    If you have to whine and complain, do it here, _not_ in any other category.  
    But really, we'd prefer it if you participated in constructive discussion in another Category.  Whining and complaining doesn't help.

* [Blogs](...): "Blog posts from individual members"

    This Category is not used much.  If you have something that you feel is more "blog"-like than "discussion oriented",
    it could go there.
